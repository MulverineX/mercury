QuickJS bindings and web-compliant polyfills wrapped up in flutter library with [legacy](https://github.com/openkraken/kraken) behind it. Aims to be an efficient & fully-featured library to run JavaScript in a flutter app, from simple eval to acting as the app's logic/backend core.

Eventually, this library will be used by https://github.com/openwebf/webf as a superset to provide DOM interactions and rendering. This should also encourage better maintenance, as WebF contributors iterating on the JS core of the framework will contribute here. See https://github.com/openwebf/mercury/issues/16
